3 tracks

1. collect insurance premiums and put them in a vault, as a pool
2. an escrow account that collects data from the source through oracles, checks the conditions and if triggered, will disburse the claims to the victim.
3. data monetisation: user installs sensors and uploads the data. Researchers / large enterprises who want access to this kind of hyperlocal real-time data would pay for it. Farmers now have a stable source of income.

now dealing with tampering of sensors, 3 ways,

1. AI model that collects historial data. Will flag a piece of data as suspicious if there is an unusual or sudden deviation in values.
2. 51% attack - data from multiple sources in a region is aggregated, and anomalies in induvidual sensors will be red-flagged
3. Satellite data that is broadly available will be used to validate the on-site data, if on-site data deviates unusually from the satellite data, this sensor would be flagged as suspicious.

Also, the farmer has incentive to not tamper with the data because, being flagged as suspicious would hurt his reputation and risk losing future income through track 3: Data Monetisation.
