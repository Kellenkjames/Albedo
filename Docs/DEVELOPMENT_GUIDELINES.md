## Introduction

This document serves as a guide for development best practices for the DePIN project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that our codebase remains clean, and our collaboration is streamlined.

## Git Guidelines

### Initialization

Make sure you have the latest version of the repository before starting your work:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Pushing Changes

1. **How to Push**: After you've made your changes, make sure to add and commit them before pushing.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Commit message explaining what you did"
    git push origin <your-branch>
    ```

2. **When to Push**: Push your changes whenever you complete a feature or fix a bug. Do not push half-implemented features.

### Pulling Changes

1. **How to Pull**: Before starting your work, make sure you have the latest version of the codebase.

    ```bash
    git pull origin <your-branch>
    ```

2. **When to Pull**: Always pull the latest changes before starting to code and before pushing your changes.

### Branching

1. **Creating a Branch**: Whenever you start work on a new feature or bugfix, create a new branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

2. **Branch Naming**: Use clear, concise names for your branches. For example, `feature/add-login` or `bugfix/resolve-memory-leak`.

### Merges and Pull Requests

1. **Creating a Pull Request**: Once you're done with your changes and have pushed them, create a pull request (PR) through GitHub.

2. **Reviewing**: All PRs should be reviewed by at least one other developer. Do not merge your own PR without review.

3. **Merging**: Once the PR has been reviewed and all comments have been addressed, the reviewer should merge the PR.

## Coding Standards

- Follow the Rust style guide for all Rust code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add comments to explain complex or unclear sections of code.
- Keep functions and methods short. If a function is growing too large or handling multiple tasks, consider breaking it into smaller functions.

## Issue Tracking and Task Assignment

- Use GitHub Issues for task management.
- Assign issues to specific milestones to keep track of progress towards project goals.
- Use labels like `bug`, `feature`, and `documentation` to easily sort and identify issues.

## Conflict Resolution

- In case of a merge conflict, the person who encounters the conflict should notify the team.
- Work together to resolve the conflict and merge the changes.

## Documentation

- Code should be self-documenting wherever possible.
- Use comments for complex code logic and public API documentation.
- Update README and other documentation files as needed when you add new features or change existing ones.

## Code Reviews

- Look for code quality, readability, and maintainability in reviews.
- Ensure that new code adheres to established coding and documentation standards.
- Make sure that all tests pass before approving a PR.

## Testing Strategies

- Use [Your Preferred Test Framework] for unit and integration testing.
- Write unit tests for all new functions and methods.
- Make sure all tests pass before submitting a PR for review.

## Coding Sessions and Stand-ups

- Weekly stand-ups to discuss progress, roadblocks, and next steps.
- Optional pair-programming sessions for complex features or bugs.

## General Best Practices

- **Testing**: Make sure to write tests for your features and bug fixes.
- **Code Reviews**: Take code reviews seriously, both as the reviewer and the one being reviewed.
- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful commit messages. They should describe what was done and why.
