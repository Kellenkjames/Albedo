1. What if weather was bad, but crop output was good, or vice versa ?
Ans. If the weather is bad, the user gets the payout, if the weather is good, the user doesn't get the payout. The user is not insured against crop output, he is insured against bad weather conditions.
It can be expanded beyond agricuture, for example, let's say due to frequent rains on a construction site, the construction is delayed, so the construction company can get a payout from our on-chain insurance program. Again insurance against bad weather conditions, not against construction deadlines.

2. What if the user tampers with the sensor data ?
Ans. The farmer has incentive to not tamper with the data because, being flagged as suspicious would hurt his reputation and risk losing future income through track 3: Data Monetisation. Following are the ways we can deal with tampering of sensors,
    1. AI model that collects historial data. Will flag a piece of data as suspicious if there is an unusual or sudden deviation in values.
    2. 51% attack - data from multiple sources in a region is aggregated, and anomalies in induvidual sensors will be red-flagged
    3. Satellite data that is broadly available will be used to validate the on-site data, if on-site data deviates unusually from the satellite data, this sensor would be flagged as suspicious.
